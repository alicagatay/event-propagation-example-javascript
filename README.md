# JavaScript Event Propagation Example

JavaScript Event Propagation Example is a simple project I have created in order to practice my understandings of event propagation, event bubbling and event capturing in JavaScript.

This project is made by using pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. No frameworks or libraries are used.
